# Release Sessions

Sessions.app is the primary macOS release vehicle. Standalone Go archives remain
a secondary headless/developer distribution, not the product's main install or
update story.

## Current state

The checked-in Tauri application builds as `Sessions.app`. It bundles signed Go
binaries and implements idempotent first install, health/discovery checks,
live-session baseline verification, rollback for daemon upgrades, and a signed
Tauri updater. The first public updater manifest is intentionally absent until
the corresponding immutable archive is notarized and uploaded. Do not publish
a placeholder manifest or point it at a mutable artifact.

Developer builds may use their own updater key:

```sh
npm run bootstrap
TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY=/path/to/development-updater.key TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY_PASSWORD='' npm run tauri:build
```

The resulting `.app` is a local development artifact. A Developer ID signature
alone is not a public release: the final bundle must also be notarized and
stapled.

## macOS app release gate

Before publishing a version:

1. Start from a clean reviewed commit on the current product branch.
2. Run the full Go, frontend, and Rust gates.
3. Build signed embedded Go binaries and the containing app.
4. Verify every nested executable with `codesign --verify --strict`.
5. Exercise a first install and an upgrade against scratch state.
6. Prove the pre/post session baseline and rollback behavior.
7. Submit for notarization, staple the ticket, and require `spctl` acceptance.
8. Sign and publish the updater manifest and immutable app artifact.
9. Install through the same channel a customer will use and repeat the health
   and session-adoption check.

The required Apple credential is an app-specific password or App Store Connect
API key. Credentials are release secrets and must never be committed.

For the Apple-account path, sign in at `https://account.apple.com`, open
**Sign-In and Security → App-Specific Passwords**, and generate one named for
Sessions notarization. Two-factor authentication must already be enabled. Use
that generated value as `APPLE_PASSWORD` for one release shell; never use the
primary Apple Account password and never write either value to this repository.

```sh
export APPLE_ID='your Apple Account email'
export APPLE_PASSWORD='the generated app-specific password'
export APPLE_TEAM_ID='7GW9T5ZWW8'
```

## Reproducible updater release

The production updater public key is committed at `release/updater.pub`; its
private half lives outside the repository at
`~/.config/sessions/sessions-updater.key` with mode `0600`. Back it up securely:
losing it prevents every installed build from accepting future updates.

Keep the version synchronized in `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`,
`src-tauri/Cargo.toml`, and `frontend/package.json`, prepare release notes, then
run the non-mutating preflight:

```sh
scripts/release-app.sh --version 0.1.0 --notes-file /path/to/notes.md --dry-run
```

After exporting Apple notarization credentials, run the same command without
`--dry-run`. It builds and signs `Sessions.app`, verifies nested runtime
binaries, validates notarization/stapling/Gatekeeper, and writes
`release/out/v<version>/latest.json`. It does not publish or install anything.

Upload `Sessions.app.tar.gz` and its `.sig` to the immutable GitHub release tag
first. Then use the somewhere project's `project_patch` operation to replace
only `releases/latest.json` with the rendered manifest. Do not deploy a
one-file directory: a full static deploy can remove the onboarding pages. Read
the file back from production and install through the app's Settings → Sessions
updates flow before announcing the release.

## Standalone binary archives

The secondary archive builder remains available for automation and unsupported
headless installs:

```sh
./runtime/scripts/release.sh --version 0.1.0 --dry-run
./runtime/scripts/release.sh --version 0.1.0
```

Each archive contains adjacent `sessions`, `sessionsd`, and `sessions-runner` binaries,
`LICENSE`, and `README.md`, with a matching SHA-256 file. Homebrew may remain a
power-user channel, but its formula is not the native app updater and must not
be presented as the primary macOS experience.

## Production mini

Shipping the macOS app does not authorize a mini cutover. The mini remains on
the Node daemon until the user schedules a joint first install after the app
has shipped. Follow [`CUTOVER.md`](CUTOVER.md) only during that separate
maintenance window.
